I'm a Test Engineer with a focus on creating efficient and reliable test automation frameworks. With extensive experience in Ruby, Cucumber, and Capybara, I specialize in building robust automated test suites that ensure high-quality software products. I have a deep understanding of software testing principles and best practices, and I am dedicated to delivering reliable test automation solutions that accelerate the testing process and improve overall product quality. I enjoy collaborating with cross-functional teams to identify test scenarios, write feature files, implement step definitions, and execute tests, resulting in comprehensive test coverage and faster feedback loops. With a keen eye for detail and a strong commitment to continuous improvement, I strive to optimize test automation efforts and enhance the overall software development lifecycle.

I recently completed an intensive data science bootcamp where I acquired a strong foundation in data analysis, machine learning, and data visualization. Through hands-on projects and real-world case studies, I gained practical experience in cleaning and manipulating data, implementing various machine learning algorithms, and creating insightful visualizations to extract valuable insights. I am skilled in Python and have worked with popular libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and scikit-learn. With a solid understanding of statistical analysis and predictive modeling techniques, I am eager to apply my data science skills to solve complex problems and uncover meaningful patterns in large datasets. I'm excited to collaborate with cross-functional teams and contribute to data-driven decision-making processes.
